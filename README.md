2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

a bar chart to compare.
5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
